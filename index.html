<p> At about 2:15 pm each afternoon, the students at P.S./I.S. 218 Rafael Hernandez Dual Language Magnet School prepare for their second learning session of the day. 450 students, grades K-8 are enrolled in an afterschool program called WHEDCO, a non-profit organization serving multifaceted programs throughout the Bronx. 

</p>

<p> The program at P.S 218 is designed to enrich students' lives by providing homework help, extra-curricular activities, and high school prep for the senior student body. 

Some of the program’s activities include baking, basketball, gardening, and more. Many after- school programs have taken a multifaceted approach with their curriculum as an attempt to keep students engaged. 

According to New York State Network for Youth Success, participation in after-school programming increases learning engagement, while decreasing behavioral issues and increasing low attendance rates. 
 </p>

<p> While the expansion of after-school could trigger an alarm of academic decline, it could very well be a great sign of improvement. 

Jack Zaccara, executive director of One World United and Virtuous, a non-profit organization that specializes in developing accessible after-school programs around the country believes that program growth could be attributed to multiple factors. I think greater understanding from parents, exposure to character education, additional professional development for staff, a sense of lifelong learning, and an after school “community” can make a difference and maybe that’s what’s happening across NYC” he said.
